- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded the contructors in each class to be able to contruct buildings even when not given the full information. The Cafe class has a full constructor, and overloaded constructor that defaults all stocks in inventory to 300, and an overloaded constructor with just name and address that deafaults the nFloors to 1. The House class has a full constructor, an overloaded constructor that defaults the dining and elevator availability to false, and an overloaded constructor with just name and address that deafaults the nFloors to 1. The Library class has a full contructor, an overloaded constructor with address, and an overloaded constructor with name and address. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was good to have overrides and overloads so that the methods are customized and accounts for different situations, without having to repeat the codes. I didn't use overload in a creative way so I wonder what else I could try. It was helpful to have this practice for understanding polymorphism.
